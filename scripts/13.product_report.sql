Product Report
==========================================================================================================

Purpose:
This report consolidates key product metrics and behaviors.

Highlights:
	1. Gathers essential fields such as product name, category, subcategory, and cost.
	2. Segments products by revenue to identify High-Performers, Mid-Range, or Low-Performers.
	3. Aggregates product-level metrics:
		- total orders
		- total sales
		- total quantity sold
		- total products (unique)
	     - lifespan (in months)
	4. Calculates valuable KPIs:
		- recency (months since last sale)
		- average order revenue (AOR)
		- average monthly revenue
